# Obtaining an API Key

To start using the VisionCraft API, you need to obtain an API key. This key is essential for every request to the API. You can obtain the key by following these steps:

1.  **Subscribe to the** [**VisionCraft Telegram channel**](https://t.me/visioncraft\_channel)**.**

    **To receive an** **API key**, users are **required** to be subscribed to this **channel**. If you are already subscribed, proceed to the next step.
2.  **Send the `/key` command to the** [**VisionCraft bot**](https://t.me/VisionCraft\_bot)**.**

    After **subscribing** to the channel, send this command to the bot in the chat. The bot's response will contain your API key. Please save this key, as it will be used for **authentication** when **interacting** with the API. Key generation takes approximately 15 seconds.
3.  **Secure your key.**

    It is essential to **protect your API key**. Do not share it with other users, and do not post it in public places. Otherwise, your key will be banned, and generating a new key is not possible. One Telegram account is associated with one key.

It's important to note that your **API key is linked** to your subscription **to** the **VisionCraft Telegram channel**. If you **unsubscribe** from the channel, your key **will cease** to function. However, when you **resubscribe** to the channel, the key **automatically renews** its **functionality**.
